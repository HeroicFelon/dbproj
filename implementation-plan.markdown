## Article Collection Module

The Article Collection Module automates fetching articles from various sources, forming the foundation of the system by providing data for processing.

### Step 1: Set up a basic web crawler using crawl4ai

- **Task**: Create a crawl4ai spider to fetch articles from a single website (e.g., a news site).
- **Implementation**:
  - Define a crawl4ai spider (Python class or YAML config) to extract article titles, URLs, and content asynchronously.
  - Save fetched articles as text files in a local directory (e.g., `articles/`).
- **Test**:
  - Run the spider and verify that articles are saved in the local directory.
  - Check that the extracted content is clean and readable.

### Step 2: Implement RSS feed parsing

- **Task**: Add functionality to parse RSS feeds and fetch articles.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use `feedparser` to parse RSS feeds.
  - Extract titles, URLs, and content from feed entries.
  - Save articles to the same local directory.
- **Test**:
  - Parse a sample RSS feed (e.g., a tech blog’s feed).
  - Verify that articles are saved correctly with expected content.

### Step 3: Integrate API interactions for fetching articles

- **Task**: Add support for fetching articles from APIs (e.g., arXiv).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use `requests` to interact with the API.
  - Handle API authentication (e.g., API keys stored in `config.yaml`).
  - Save article data to the local directory.
- **Test**:
  - Fetch articles from a sample API (e.g., arXiv’s API).
  - Verify that articles are saved with correct metadata.

### Step 4: Implement a scheduler for regular fetching

- **Task**: Schedule fetching tasks to run daily.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Python’s `schedule` library to run the crawl4ai spider, RSS parser, and API fetcher periodically.
  - Ensure compatibility with all sources.
- **Test**:
  - Set up a daily schedule.
  - Verify that new articles are fetched and saved at the scheduled time.

## Database Enhancement Module

The Database Enhancement Module processes fetched articles, extracts metadata, and performs NLP tasks, building on the collected data.

### Step 1: Set up a database to store articles and metadata

- **Task**: Set up Elasticsearch or PostgreSQL to store articles.
- **Implementation**:
  - For Elasticsearch: Create an index with mappings for fields (title, content, source, date).
  - For PostgreSQL: Create tables for articles and metadata.
- **Test**:
  - Insert a sample article into the database.
  - Retrieve it and verify all fields are stored correctly.

### Step 2: Implement text extraction from different formats

- **Task**: Extract clean text from HTML and PDF files.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use `BeautifulSoup` for HTML text extraction (e.g., from `<p>` tags).
  - Use `pdfplumber` for PDF text extraction.
- **Test**:
  - Extract text from a sample HTML and PDF file.
  - Verify that the extracted text is clean and readable.

### Step 3: Implement sentiment analysis

- **Task**: Analyze article sentiment using SpaCy.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use SpaCy’s sentiment analysis or a pre-trained model.
  - Classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Test**:
  - Analyze sentiment of a sample article.
  - Verify that the classification aligns with the article’s tone.

### Step 4: Implement topic classification

- **Task**: Classify articles into topics using Scikit-learn.
- **Implementation**:
  - Train a simple classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes) or use a pre-trained model.
  - Classify topics like “AI” or “Biotechnology.”
- **Test**:
  - Classify a sample article.
  - Verify that the topic matches the article’s content.

### Step 5: Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- **Task**: Extract named entities using SpaCy.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use SpaCy’s NER model to identify entities (e.g., persons, organizations).
- **Test**:
  - Extract entities from a sample article.
  - Verify that entities are correctly identified.

### Step 6: Implement keyword extraction

- **Task**: Extract keywords using TF-IDF or RAKE.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Scikit-learn’s `TfidfVectorizer` or `rake_nltk`.
- **Test**:
  - Extract keywords from a sample article.
  - Verify that keywords are relevant to the content.

### Step 7: Implement EEI identification

- **Task**: Identify Essential Elements of Information (EEIs) based on user criteria.
- **Implementation**:
  - Define EEI criteria (e.g., key phrases) in `config.yaml`.
  - Use regex or NLP to identify EEIs.
- **Test**:
  - Identify EEIs in a sample article.
  - Verify that they match the defined criteria.

### Step 8: Implement AI/LLM-based lead generation

- **Task**: Generate research leads using an AI/LLM.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a pre-trained LLM (e.g., BERT) to suggest related topics.
- **Test**:
  - Generate leads for a sample article.
  - Verify that leads are relevant.

### Step 9: Implement AI/LLM-based research plan generation

- **Task**: Generate research plans using an AI/LLM.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use an LLM to suggest investigation steps based on content.
- **Test**:
  - Generate a plan for a sample article.
  - Verify that it’s coherent and actionable.

## User Interface

The User Interface enables interaction with the database and viewing of insights, built on the processed data.

### Step 1: Set up a basic web app

- **Task**: Create a web app using Flask or Django.
- **Implementation**:
  - Set up routes for a homepage.
- **Test**:
  - Run the app and verify the homepage loads.

### Step 2: Implement search functionality

- **Task**: Add search to query articles by content and metadata.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Elasticsearch’s query DSL or PostgreSQL’s full-text search.
  - Display results on a search page.
- **Test**:
  - Search for a sample article.
  - Verify that results are accurate.

### Step 3: Implement visualization of insights

- **Task**: Display visualizations (e.g., sentiment trends).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Matplotlib or Plotly for charts.
  - Integrate into the web app.
- **Test**:
  - Display a sample chart (e.g., sentiment distribution).
  - Verify that it renders correctly.

### Step 4: Implement display of AI-generated leads and plans

- **Task**: Show leads and research plans for articles.
- **Implementation**:
  - Add a section to the article detail page.
- **Test**:
  - Display leads and plans for a sample article.
  - Verify that they display correctly.

### Step 5: Implement export functionality

- **Task**: Allow exporting reports in PDF or CSV.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use `reportlab` for PDF or `csv` for CSV export.
- **Test**:
  - Export a sample report.
  - Verify that the file contains the correct data.
