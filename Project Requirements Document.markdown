# Project Requirements Document: Automated Research and Database Enhancement System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a system designed to automate the research and collection phase of your workflow, while enhancing your private database with advanced functionalities. You currently read dozens of science and technology articles daily and save them manually. The goal is to streamline this process and add intelligent features like sentiment analysis, classification, named entity recognition, keyword extraction, EEI identification, and AI-assisted lead and research plan generation.

## 2. Current Workflow

You conduct online research on developments in science and technology, reading dozens of articles daily from various online sources and saving them to a private database. This manual process is time-consuming, and you seek to automate it while adding advanced analytical capabilities.

## 3. System Overview

The system will consist of three main components:

- **Article Collection Module**: Automates the fetching of articles from specified sources.
- **Database Enhancement Module**: Processes articles to extract metadata, perform NLP tasks, and generate insights.
- **User Interface**: Allows you to interact with the database, search articles, and view generated insights.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Article Collection Module
- Automatically fetch articles from user-defined sources (e.g., websites, RSS feeds, APIs).
- Support multiple sources with the ability to easily add new ones.
- Schedule fetching at regular intervals (e.g., daily) to keep the database up-to-date.
- Handle different formats (HTML, PDF, etc.) and extract clean text content for processing.

### 4.2 Database Enhancement Module
- Store articles with associated metadata (e.g., source, publication date, language).
- Perform **sentiment analysis** on article content to determine the tone (positive, negative, neutral).
- Classify articles automatically by:
  - **Topic** (e.g., AI, biotechnology, quantum computing) using machine learning models.
  - **Source** (e.g., website or publication name).
  - **Language** (initially English, with potential for future expansion).
- Identify **named entities** (e.g., persons, businesses, organizations, technologies) using Named Entity Recognition (NER).
- Extract **keywords** automatically using techniques like TF-IDF or RAKE.
- Identify **Essential Elements of Information (EEIs)** based on user-defined criteria (e.g., key findings, innovations, or trends).
- Use an AI/LLM to generate **potential leads** for follow-on research (e.g., related topics or articles).
- Use an AI/LLM to generate **research plans** suggesting further investigation based on article content.

### 4.3 User Interface
- Provide search functionality to query articles by content, metadata, sentiment, topics, entities, etc.
- Visualize insights (e.g., sentiment trends, topic distributions, entity relationships).
- Display AI-generated leads and research plans for each article or topic.
- Export reports or summaries in formats like PDF or CSV.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- Utilize multi-threading or parallel processing to handle large volumes of articles efficiently.
- Leverage GPU acceleration (via your Nvidia RTX 5080) for machine learning and NLP tasks where applicable.
- Ensure fast database queries and processing, even with a growing number of articles.

### 5.2 Scalability
- Design the system to scale with an increasing number of articles and sources.
- Optimize storage and indexing for efficient retrieval and management.

### 5.3 Security
- Store data securely in your private database, as it is for personal use.
- Implement encryption for sensitive data if required in the future.

### 5.4 Usability
- Ensure the user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Provide documentation or help resources for setup and usage.

## 6. Technical Specifications

### 6.1 Hardware
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D (8 Core/16 Thread) – Supports parallel processing for article fetching and NLP tasks.
- **GPU**: Nvidia RTX 5080 (16 GB DDR7 VRAM) – Enables GPU-accelerated machine learning and LLM tasks.
- **RAM**: 64 GB DDR5 – Sufficient for handling large datasets and models in memory.
- **Storage**: 2 TB NVMe M.2 SSD – Provides fast, ample storage for articles and database.
- **OS**: Windows 11 Pro with WSL (Ubuntu) – Allows flexibility in development and deployment.

### 6.2 Software Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x – Ideal for its rich ecosystem of NLP and machine learning libraries.
- **Database**: 
  - **Elasticsearch** – For powerful full-text search and scalability.
  - **PostgreSQL** – Alternative with full-text search capabilities for structured data.
- **NLP Libraries**: 
  - **SpaCy** – For NER and sentiment analysis.
  - **NLTK** or **TextBlob** – For additional NLP tasks.
  - **Scikit-learn** – For topic classification.
- **Web Scraping**: 
  - **BeautifulSoup** – For simple HTML parsing.
  - **Scrapy** – For robust, scheduled scraping of multiple sources.
- **Machine Learning/LLM**: 
  - **PyTorch** – For GPU-accelerated models (e.g., classification, LLM tasks).
  - **Pre-trained Models** – BERT or smaller LLMs suitable for local execution with 16 GB VRAM.
- **UI Framework**: 
  - **Flask** or **Django** – For a lightweight web app interface.
  - **PyQt** – Alternative for a desktop application.

## 7. Constraints and Assumptions
- Articles are primarily in English; multilingual support can be added later if needed.
- You will provide examples or criteria for defining EEIs specific to your research (e.g., breakthroughs, key players).
- An internet connection is required for article fetching.
- The system is designed for single-user use; multi-user support is not required.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple languages using multilingual NLP models.
- Integrate additional data sources (e.g., academic journals, APIs).
- Include advanced analytics (e.g., trend analysis, network graphs of entities).
- Enable exportable visualizations for presentations or reports.
