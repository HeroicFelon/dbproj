# Project Requirements Document: Automated Research and Database Enhancement System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a system designed to automate the research and collection phase of your workflow, while enhancing your private database with advanced functionalities. You can use this as a reference for implementation and further feature planning.

## 2. Current Workflow

You conduct online research on developments in science and technology, reading dozens of articles daily from various online sources and saving them to a private database. This manual process is time-consuming and difficult to scale as your interests and information sources grow.

## 3. System Overview

The system will consist of three main components:

- **Article Collection Module**: Automates the fetching of articles from specified sources.
- **Database Enhancement Module**: Processes articles to extract metadata, perform NLP tasks, and generate insights.
- **User Interface**: Allows you to interact with the database, search articles, and view generated insights.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Article Collection Module
- Automatically fetch articles from user-defined sources (e.g., websites, RSS feeds, APIs).
- Use **crawl4ai** for web crawling and scraping, supporting multiple sources and easy extensibility for new sites.
- Schedule fetching at regular intervals (e.g., daily) to keep the database up-to-date.
- Handle different formats (HTML, PDF, etc.) and extract clean text content for processing.

### 4.2 Database Enhancement Module
- Store articles with associated metadata (e.g., source, publication date, language).
- Perform **sentiment analysis** on article content to determine the tone (positive, negative, neutral).
- Classify articles automatically by:
  - **Topic** (e.g., AI, biotechnology, quantum computing) using machine learning models.
  - **Source** (e.g., website or publication name).
  - **Language** (initially English, with potential for future expansion).
- Identify **named entities** (e.g., persons, businesses, organizations, technologies) using Named Entity Recognition (NER).
- Extract **keywords** automatically using techniques like TF-IDF or RAKE.
- Identify **Essential Elements of Information (EEIs)** based on user-defined criteria (e.g., key findings, innovations, or trends).
- Use an AI/LLM to generate **potential leads** for follow-on research (e.g., related topics or articles).
- Use an AI/LLM to generate **research plans** suggesting further investigation based on article content.

### 4.3 User Interface
- Provide search functionality to query articles by content, metadata, sentiment, topics, entities, etc.
- Visualize insights (e.g., sentiment trends, topic distributions, entity relationships).
- Display AI-generated leads and research plans for each article or topic.
- Export reports or summaries in formats like PDF or CSV.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- Utilize asynchronous crawling with crawl4ai to efficiently handle large volumes of articles.
- Leverage multi-threading or parallel processing for additional tasks.
- Leverage GPU acceleration (via your Nvidia RTX 5080) for machine learning and NLP tasks where applicable.
- Ensure fast database queries and processing, even with a growing number of articles.

### 5.2 Scalability
- Design the system to scale with an increasing number of articles and sources.
- Optimize storage and indexing for efficient retrieval and management.

### 5.3 Security
- Store data securely in your private database, as it is for personal use.
- Implement encryption for sensitive data if required in the future.

### 5.4 Usability
- Ensure the user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Provide documentation or help resources for setup and usage.

## 6. Technical Specifications

### 6.1 Hardware
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D (8 Core/16 Thread) – Supports parallel processing for article fetching and NLP tasks.
- **GPU**: Nvidia RTX 5080 (16 GB DDR7 VRAM) – Enables GPU-accelerated machine learning and LLM tasks.
- **RAM**: 64 GB DDR5 – Sufficient for handling large datasets and models in memory.
- **Storage**: 2 TB NVMe M.2 SSD – Provides fast, ample storage for articles and database.
- **OS**: Windows 11 Pro with WSL (Ubuntu) – Allows flexibility in development and deployment.

### 6.2 Software Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x – Ideal for its rich ecosystem of NLP and machine learning libraries.
- **Web Crawling**: 
  - **crawl4ai** – For modern, async-based, modular web crawling and scraping.
  - **feedparser** – For parsing RSS feeds.
  - **requests** – For HTTP/API requests.
- **Database**: 
  - **Elasticsearch** – For powerful full-text search and scalability.
  - **PostgreSQL** – Alternative with full-text search capabilities for structured data.
- **NLP Libraries**: 
  - **SpaCy** – For NER and sentiment analysis.
  - **NLTK** or **TextBlob** – For additional NLP tasks.
  - **Scikit-learn** – For topic classification.
- **Web Scraping Utilities**: 
  - **BeautifulSoup** – For HTML parsing.
  - **pdfplumber** – For PDF text extraction.
- **Machine Learning/LLM**: 
  - **PyTorch** – For GPU-accelerated models (e.g., classification, LLM tasks).
  - **Pre-trained Models** – BERT or smaller LLMs suitable for local execution with 16 GB VRAM.
- **UI Framework**: 
  - **Flask** or **Django** – For a lightweight web app interface.
  - **PyQt** – Alternative for a desktop application.

## 7. Constraints and Assumptions
- Articles are primarily in English; multilingual support can be added later if needed.
- You will provide examples or criteria for defining EEIs specific to your research (e.g., breakthroughs, key players).
- An internet connection is required for article fetching.
- The system is designed for single-user use; multi-user support is not required.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple languages using multilingual NLP models.
- Integrate additional data sources (e.g., academic journals, APIs).
- Include advanced analytics (e.g., trend analysis, network graphs of entities).
- Enable exportable visualizations for presentations or reports.
